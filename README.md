# Area 51 (2005) Source Code
{>>" # Hello.h hello
Welcome to the unofficial release of the Area 51 (2005) video game source code! This project aims to resurrect and preserve a piece of early 2000s video game history for enthusiasts, historians, and developers alike. Below is a brief overview of the source code details, its origin, and guidance on how the community can help bring this game into the modern era.

## How to Contribute

The main goal is to get the source code into a buildable state on modern systems. Whether you're interested in game development, historical preservation, or simply a fan of Area 51, here's how you can help:

1. **Building the Project:** Assistance is needed to compile and run the game on contemporary hardware. If you have experience with game development, legacy systems, or cross-platform development, your expertise is invaluable.
2. **Documentation and Research:** Insights into the original development environment, including compilers, libraries, and tools, would greatly assist the restoration effort.
3. **Debugging and Porting:** Once buildable, the project will require debugging and potentially porting to newer platforms to reach a wider audience.
4. **Forking and contributing:** Make changes in your forks, and submit a pull request with your updates.

## Building PC Code

The following prerequisites are required to build the source tree for PC:

1. **Visual Studio .Net 2003**
2. **XtremeToolkit 4100** | Install it from "xCore\3rdParty\CodeJock"
3. **Xbox SDK - 5849**
4. You'll need to create an environment variable called **X** and **S** that points to the important library directions of the source tree. For example, if the source tree is located at **'D:\area51-pc'** the **X** environment variable should point to **'D:\area51-pc\xCore'**. the **S** environment variable should point to **'D:\area51-pc\Support'**
5. Put game assets to **'C:\GameData\A51\Release\PC\DVD'**
